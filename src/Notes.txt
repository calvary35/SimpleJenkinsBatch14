CI/CD:
    Continuous Integration and Continuous Development
    All of the software that we use whether it's a website or any operating system.
    They are in a continuous state of change. We need to continuously develop and update these software
    so that the customer can use the latest features. Jenkins is one such software that will help us automate
    this process.

1. Once the software is ready and looks good on the developers machine. Developer
    pushes that code to the development server. The developer verifies the changes and runs a few test cases
    to make sure everything works as expected.
2. Once all looks good QA will request to deploy the changes on QA server. We also need to take approvals from team
    leads or managers.
3. Once all looks good on QA take approval from head of team and write an email again to deploy all the changes to
    the staging server.
4. Once all looks good on staging the same will be done for production.
